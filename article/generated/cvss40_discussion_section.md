# Discussion section draft

The results support the feasibility of using an AI/watcher-assisted workflow to structure Environmental metric assessment around evidence, uncertainty, and reviewability. The workflow does not change the CVSS v4.0 formula and does not claim to produce autonomous official scores. Instead, it separates official Base severity from consumer-side Environmental assessment support.

The hybrid dataset improves over a purely synthetic evaluation by incorporating real NVD CVE records with CVSS v4.0 data. However, the Environmental contexts remain curated to evaluate the workflow under controlled assumptions. This design is appropriate for a method/prototype paper, but it should not be presented as evidence of production effectiveness or predictive superiority.

The strongest contribution is traceability: each scenario links the candidate Environmental assessment to evidence summaries, uncertainty flags, review status, and trace JSON. This makes the decision path inspectable and supports reproducibility. The main practical implication is that security teams can use the workflow to make Environmental assessment more explicit and auditable, while keeping final metric selection under human review.
